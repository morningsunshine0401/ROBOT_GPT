# ROBOT_GPT

 ## Using chatgpt api + whisper api + UDP to control Tello drone
 
 It is basically making chatgpt use functions for controlling tello drone like  building a Lego. I made functions(like Lego blocks) for gpt, so that gpt can use it to perform given tasks for a drone.
 
  I made it use only the given functions to perform tasks for a drone. Chatgpt is capable of making algorithms for the task but it is hard to ensure that it works. So I made gpt to use only the given functions in a given way.
